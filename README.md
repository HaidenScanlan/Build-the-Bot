# Build-the-Bot
Welcome to the Build-the-Bot platform! Build-the-Bot is an open-source Arduino based robotics platform maintained by the Watson Combat Robotics League at Binghamton University!

To get started, read the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/wcrl/Build-the-Bot/blob/453a59d6409c2aacc2f1eb8cd54fe76791a7de1f/Getting%20Started/Getting%20Started.md) and the [3D Printing Guide](https://github.com/wcrl/Build-the-Bot/blob/453a59d6409c2aacc2f1eb8cd54fe76791a7de1f/Getting%20Started/3D%20Printing%20Guide.md). From there, start designing and planning out your bot! 

If you have any questions, please contact us via our discord, or email WCRL@binghamton.edu.
